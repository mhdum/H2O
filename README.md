## Project Overview üöÄ

Our solution to the global water scarcity problem is a mobile application designed to share water-efficient techniques and methods. The app serves as a centralized platform similar to a wiki, where users can contribute peer-reviewed articles, engage in community discussions, and access interactive tools for optimizing water usage.

The goal of this app is to help minimize water wastage, especially in agriculture, by increasing awareness and providing easy access to a variety of water-saving techniques and methods. It also provides practical tools to calculate water usage and measure its efficiency.

## Tech Stack üíª

The technologies and tools we have used to build our water-efficiency knowledge-sharing app are:

- **React Native**: Framework for building the cross-platform mobile app.
- **Expo**: For rapid app development and testing.
- **Node.js**: Backend for handling API calls and user authentication.
- **Express.js**: Framework for API routing and handling requests.
- **Headless CMS** (e.g., Strapi, Contentful): For managing articles and content.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user and article data.
- **Firebase**: For user authentication and real-time database.
- **Social Media APIs**: To enable sharing of articles and discussions.
- **Redux**: For state management.
- **Heroku**: For backend deployment.

## Challenges and Solutions üß†

### Challenges:
- **Article Moderation**

: Ensuring that user-submitted articles are accurate and adhere to platform guidelines.

**Solution**: Implemented an admin review system where all user-generated content is screened before publishing.

- **Data Security**: Protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access.

**Solution**: Integrated **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and implemented input validation and sanitization to mitigate risks like XSS and SQL injection.

- **Engagement**: Encouraging users to contribute articles and participate in discussions.

**Solution**: Introduced social media sharing features and gamification elements like badges and user rankings for active contributors.

## Future Enhancements üöß

1. **Multi-Lingual Support**: Offer the app in multiple languages to cater to a broader audience.
   
2. **Offline Access**: Enable users to access stored articles and tools without an internet connection, making it accessible in remote areas.

3. **Government Integration**: Collaborate with governmental organizations to provide official water-saving techniques and real-time data on water policies.

4. **User Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback system where users can rate articles and suggest improvements to the platform.

5. **Voice and Text-to-Speech Support**: Include accessibility features for visually impaired users, allowing them to interact with the app using voice commands or screen readers.
